# Two-Player Othello

A simple two-player simulation of Othello with a GUI. Players must set up
a game by inputting the board size, the placement of the four center pieces, 
the player to make the first move, and the goal of the game. When the game 
starts, the screen will display the scoreboard and notify the players of 
their turn. The first player makes a move by clicking on an appropriate cell. 
Players proceed to alternatively play the game through this method until 
there are either no more valid moves for at least one player or no more 
empty cells on the board.
